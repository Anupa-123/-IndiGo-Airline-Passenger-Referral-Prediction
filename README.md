# IndiGo-Airline-Passenger-Referral-Prediction
The objective of this machine learning project is to categorize airlines based on specific features and attributes. Such classification can serve various strategic purposes, including identifying suitable partners for codeshare agreements, informing pricing strategies, and supporting market analysis.

This is where machine learning can play a vital role. By using historical customer data, a machine learning model can identify patterns and correlations that indicate a high likelihood of referral. This information can then be used by airlines to target specific customers with personalized marketing campaigns or incentives, increasing the chances of referral and promoting growth.

In conclusion, a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of referral can provide valuable insights for airlines looking to enhance their customer satisfaction and drive growth through word-of-mouth referrals.
